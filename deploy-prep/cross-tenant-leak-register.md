# Cross-Tenant Leak Register — proven leaks, prioritized for Q3 fix ordering

**Status:** consolidation / file-only (no route code changed by this doc or its witness tests)
**Author:** W2 (resolver + tenant-isolation lane)
**Date:** 2026-07-12
**Purpose:** one prioritized register of every cross-tenant leak this lane has
**proven with an executable witness** — so Q3 can fix them in impact order and lock
each fix with the witness already written. Structural claims that lack a witness
are NOT in the priority list; they live in §4 (open suspicions) so nothing is
smuggled in as "proven."

Every finding below is backed by a test that runs against
`src/test/tenant-isolation-harness.ts` (`createTenantDbHarness`), an in-memory fake
that **actually applies `tenantDb`'s `.eq('tenant_id', …)` scoping and `tenant_id`
stamping**. So a "proven-LIVE" row is a real exploit reproduction (the attack
succeeds through the same scoping the route really uses), and an "already-blocked"
row proves the guard fires — neither is a structural assertion that can rot.

---

## 0. How to read this

- **proven-LIVE** = witness test asserts the cross-tenant effect **happens today**.
  These are the Q3 fix list. Each has a **required guard**; when it lands, **flip
  the witness** to expect rejection and it becomes the permanent regression lock.
- **already-blocked** = witness/control proves an existing guard stops the
  cross-tenant path. No fix needed; the test is a regression lock so a future edit
  can't silently remove the guard.
- **Why `tenantDb` doesn't already cover these:** every platform query uses the
  service_role key (RLS bypassed). `tenantDb(tenantId)` closes the common case by
  auto-scoping reads and stamping writes — but it **cannot** protect (a) a table
  with no `tenant_id` column, or (b) a caller-supplied **foreign-key id** that the
  route inserts without an ownership check. Every leak below is one of those two
  shapes.

## 1. Priority fix list — PROVEN-LIVE leaks

Ranked by blast radius (destructive + data-exfil first, reference-pollution after).

### P0 — `crews` PATCH → `crew_members` roster wipe + pollution  ⚠️ **DESTRUCTIVE** — ✅ **FIXED**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Route / op** | `PATCH /api/crews` → `setMembers()` (`src/app/api/crews/route.ts`) |
| **Table** | `crew_members` — **no `tenant_id` column**, keyed `(crew_id, team_member_id)` |
| **Attack vector** | `PATCH { id: <victim crew id>, member_ids: [...] }`. `body.id` was caller-supplied and never verified tenant-owned. `setMembers` scoped its `delete`/`insert` by `crew_id` alone. |
| **Effect** | **(1) Destructive:** `delete().eq('crew_id', <victim>)` **wiped another tenant's crew roster** (`member_ids: []`). **(2) Pollution:** the follow-up insert added the *attacker's own* members into the victim's crew. |
| **Verdict** | **FIXED** (was proven-LIVE) |
| **Fix** | PATCH now does a `tenantDb(tenantId).from('crews').select('id').eq('id', id).maybeSingle()` ownership check and 404s before any member write. `setMembers()` re-checks the same ownership as its first line (no-ops if the crew isn't tenant-owned), so every current and future caller is covered by construction, not just this one call site. |
| **Regression lock** | `src/app/api/crews/route.witness.test.ts` — flipped from LEAK to LOCK (3 tests: foreign-id 404 + untouched roster, foreign-id can't be polluted, positive control on own crew still works) |
| **Verified** | `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; full `vitest run` 158 files / 555 passed / 37 skipped / 0 failed |
| **Rank rationale** | Only leak here that is **destructive** *and* on a `tenant_id`-less table (`tenantDb` structurally cannot help — needs hand-written guard). Highest blast radius. |

### P1 — `bookings` POST → cross-tenant service-type **READ** + client_id FK injection  ⚠️ **DATA EXFIL** — ✅ **FIXED**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Route / op** | `POST /api/bookings` (unconverted, raw `supabaseAdmin`) |
| **Table(s)** | `service_types` (read), `bookings`/`clients` (FK) |
| **Attack vector** | **(1) READ:** `service_types.select('name').eq('id', service_type_id)` had **no tenant filter**; passing tenant B's `service_type_id` read B's service-type **name** and stamped it on A's booking. **(2) FK injection:** `client_id` was UUID-format-validated only, never ownership-checked, then inserted. |
| **Effect** | Cross-tenant **read** of B's service-type name (data exfiltration, not just a dangling reference), plus A's booking referencing B's client. |
| **Verdict** | **FIXED** (was proven-LIVE) |
| **Fix** | `service_types` read now carries `.eq('tenant_id', tenantId)` (foreign id matches nothing, name never copied). `client_id` is now verified owned by the acting tenant (`clients` lookup scoped to `tenantId`) before any other work runs — 404 on miss. |
| **Regression lock** | `src/app/api/bookings/route.witness.test.ts` — flipped from LEAK to LOCK (3 tests: foreign service_type_id name never copied, foreign client_id 404s before insert, own-tenant CONTROL still creates the booking) |
| **Verified** | `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; full `vitest run` 158 files / 559 passed / 37 skipped / 0 failed |
| **Rank rationale** | The only proven leak that performs an actual cross-tenant **READ** (exfil), not just a reference write. Above the pure FK-injection writes. |

### P2 — `invoices` POST → cross-tenant FK injection (client_id / booking_id / quote_id) — ✅ **FIXED**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Route / op** | `POST /api/invoices` (unconverted, raw `supabaseAdmin`) |
| **Table** | `invoices` (FK columns) |
| **Attack vector** | Invoice is correctly stamped `tenant_id = A`, but `body.client_id` / `body.booking_id` / `body.quote_id` were inserted **verbatim** with no ownership check. |
| **Effect** | A's finance record references B's client/booking/quote — pollutes B's entities into A's records and can surface B's data through any read-side that embeds `clients(...)` off the invoice. |
| **Verdict** | **FIXED** (was proven-LIVE) |
| **Fix** | Each of `client_id`/`booking_id`/`quote_id` is now verified tenant-owned (`.eq('id',...).eq('tenant_id', tenantId)`) before the invoice insert; 404 on any miss — including a foreign `from_booking_id`/`from_quote_id` prefill reference. |
| **Regression lock** | `src/app/api/invoices/route.witness.test.ts` — flipped from LEAK to LOCK (4 rejection tests, one per FK + from_booking_id path, + 1 same-tenant CONTROL) |
| **Verified** | `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; full `vitest run` 158 files / 559 passed / 37 skipped / 0 failed |

### P3 — `quotes` POST → cross-tenant FK injection (client_id / deal_id) — ✅ **FIXED**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Route / op** | `POST /api/quotes` (unconverted, raw `supabaseAdmin`) |
| **Table** | `quotes` (FK columns) |
| **Attack vector** | Quote stamped `tenant_id = A`; `body.client_id` and `body.deal_id` were inserted **verbatim**, no ownership check. |
| **Effect** | A's quote references B's client/deal. |
| **Verdict** | **FIXED** (was proven-LIVE) |
| **Fix** | `client_id` and `deal_id` are now verified tenant-owned before insert; 404 on miss. |
| **Asymmetry (was proven, now moot)** | The follow-up `deals` **UPDATE** on close/link **was already** scoped `.eq('id', dealId).eq('tenant_id', A)` — that guard is unchanged, it's just unreachable with a foreign `deal_id` now since the insert 404s first. |
| **Regression lock** | `src/app/api/quotes/route.witness.test.ts` — flipped from LEAK to LOCK (2 rejection tests + 1 same-tenant CONTROL proving the write-back still only touches the owned deal) |
| **Verified** | `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; full `vitest run` 158 files / 559 passed / 37 skipped / 0 failed |

### P4 — `finance/bank-accounts` POST → cross-tenant `entity_id` + `coa_id` FK injection  💰 **BANK** — ✅ **FIXED**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Route / op** | `POST /api/finance/bank-accounts` (unconverted, raw `supabaseAdmin`) |
| **Table** | `bank_accounts` (FK columns `entity_id`, `coa_id`) |
| **Attack vector** | Row stamped `tenant_id = A`, but `entity_id = body.entity_id \|\| getDefaultEntityId()` and `coa_id = body.coa_id \|\| null` were inserted **verbatim** — no ownership check on either. `entities` (mig 034) and `chart_of_accounts` (mig 032) both carry their own `tenant_id`, so both ids are cross-tenant FKs. |
| **Effect** | A's bank account links to B's accounting **entity** and B's **GL account**. `GET /api/finance/bank-accounts` embeds `entities(id, name)` + `chart_of_accounts(code, name, type)` off the row → foreign entity/account **name** surfaces back to A on read-back (exfil, not just a dangling ref). |
| **Verdict** | **FIXED** (was proven-LIVE) |
| **Fix** | Both `entity_id` (when caller-supplied) and `coa_id` are now verified tenant-owned (`.eq('id',...).eq('tenant_id', tenantId)`) before insert; 404 on either miss. |
| **Regression lock** | `src/app/api/finance/bank-accounts/route.witness.test.ts` — flipped from LEAK to LOCK (2 rejection tests, one per FK, + 2 CONTROL: default entity/null coa, and explicit own-tenant FKs) |
| **Verified** | `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; full `vitest run` 158 files / 563 passed / 37 skipped / 0 failed |
| **Rank rationale** | Two foreign FKs on a **bank** table with a read-side that embeds both parents → highest exfil surface of the new finance set. |

### P5 — `finance/expenses` POST → cross-tenant `entity_id` FK injection  💰 — ✅ **FIXED**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Route / op** | `POST /api/finance/expenses` (unconverted, raw `supabaseAdmin`) |
| **Table** | `expenses` (FK `entity_id`) |
| **Attack vector** | Row stamped `tenant_id = A`; `entity_id = body.entity_id \|\| getDefaultEntityId()` was inserted **verbatim**, no ownership check. |
| **Effect** | A's expense references B's accounting entity; finance read-sides that embed `entities(name)` surface B's entity name back to A. |
| **Verdict** | **FIXED** (was proven-LIVE) |
| **Fix** | `body.entity_id` (when caller-supplied) is now verified tenant-owned before insert; 404 on miss. |
| **Regression lock** | `src/app/api/finance/expenses/route.witness.test.ts` — flipped from LEAK to LOCK (1 rejection test + 2 CONTROL: default resolves to A's own entity, explicit own-tenant id passes) |
| **Verified** | `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; full `vitest run` 158 files / 563 passed / 37 skipped / 0 failed |

### P6 — `finance/periods` POST → cross-tenant `entity_id` FK injection (accounting close)  💰 — ✅ **FIXED**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Route / op** | `POST /api/finance/periods` (unconverted, raw `supabaseAdmin`, `upsert`) |
| **Table** | `accounting_periods` (FK `entity_id`, mig 035) |
| **Attack vector** | Row stamped `tenant_id = A`; `entity_id = body.entity_id \|\| null` was upserted **verbatim**. The on-conflict key is `(tenant_id, entity_id, year, month)`, so a foreign `entity_id` also keys a **distinct** period row. |
| **Effect** | A's month-close/period-lock record is scoped to B's entity; `GET /api/finance/periods` embeds `entities(name)` → B's entity name surfaces to A. |
| **Verdict** | **FIXED** (was proven-LIVE) |
| **Fix** | `body.entity_id` (when caller-supplied) is now verified tenant-owned before upsert; 404 on miss. |
| **Regression lock** | `src/app/api/finance/periods/route.witness.test.ts` — flipped from LEAK to LOCK (1 rejection test + 2 CONTROL: null entity when omitted, explicit own-tenant id passes) |
| **Verified** | `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; full `vitest run` 158 files / 563 passed / 37 skipped / 0 failed |

### P7 — `finance/expenses/[id]` PUT → full-body **mass-assignment** (entity_id FK + tenant_id row donation)  💰

| | |
|---|---|
| **Route / op** | `PUT /api/finance/expenses/[id]` (unconverted, raw `supabaseAdmin`) |
| **Table** | `expenses` — `update(body)` with **no column allow-list** |
| **Attack vector** | `.update(body).eq('id', id).eq('tenant_id', tenantId)`. The `tenant_id` filter scopes **which** row is hit (so foreign-row selection is **blocked** — see CONTROL), but the whole `body` is written, so the caller controls **every** column on their own row: `entity_id` (foreign FK) and `tenant_id` (overwrite → **donate** A's expense into B's books). |
| **Effect** | A's own expense repointed at B's entity, and/or A's `tenant_id` overwritten to B (row leaves A's books). Distinct shape from the INSERT leaks: mass-assignment on an already-owned row. |
| **Verdict** | **proven-LIVE** (own-row column injection); foreign-row **theft** is **already-blocked** by the `tenant_id` filter (CONTROL locks it) |
| **Witness** | `src/app/api/finance/expenses/[id]/route.witness.test.ts` (LEAK: entity_id + tenant_id set on own row; CONTROL: foreign row untouched) |
| **Required guard** | Allow-list assignable columns; never accept `tenant_id`/`entity_id` from the body without an ownership check. |
| **Rank rationale** | Lowest of the set: the `tenant_id` row-selection guard already stops cross-tenant *theft*; the residual leak is self-inflicted column injection on the caller's own row. Still real (foreign `entity_id` reference + row donation). |

### P9 — `invoices`/`quotes` PATCH `[id]` → cross-tenant `client_id` FK injection  ⚠️ **DATA EXFIL** — ✅ **FIXED**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Route / op** | `PATCH /api/invoices/[id]`, `PATCH /api/quotes/[id]` (both converted to `tenantDb`) |
| **Table** | `invoices`, `quotes` — `client_id` in the PATCH assignables allow-list, no ownership check |
| **Attack vector** | Both routes already allow-list PATCH columns (not a raw `.update(body)` spread, so not caught by the P8 grep), and `tenantDb.update()` already strips `tenant_id` from the payload — but `client_id` was accepted from the body and written verbatim with no ownership check, unlike the sibling POST routes (P2/P3) which do verify it. |
| **Effect** | Caller repoints their OWN invoice/quote at ANOTHER tenant's `client_id`. `GET /api/invoices/[id]` and `GET /api/quotes/[id]` both embed `clients(id, name, email, phone, address)` off the row, so the foreign client's PII surfaces back to the attacker's tenant on the very next read — same exfil shape as P1. |
| **Verdict** | **FIXED** (was proven-LIVE; found while sweeping `PATCH`/`PUT [id]` allow-list routes for the same FK-ownership gap as the deals/[id] fix, 2026-07-13, W2) |
| **Fix** | `client_id` is now verified tenant-owned (`db.from('clients').select('id').eq('id', client_id).maybeSingle()`, `tenantDb` auto-scopes by `tenant_id`) before either update runs; 404 on miss. Same pattern as `deals/[id]` PATCH. |
| **Regression lock** | `src/app/api/invoices/[id]/route.witness.test.ts`, `src/app/api/quotes/[id]/route.witness.test.ts` (LOCK: foreign client_id 404s, row untouched; CONTROL: own-tenant client_id and field-only updates still pass) |
| **Verified** | `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; full `vitest run` 224 files / 997 passed / 37 skipped / 0 failed |
| **Rank rationale** | Same exfil class as P1, narrower blast radius (one FK, already-allow-listed route) — placed after the P0–P8 finance/join-table sweep since it was found in a later pass over `[id]` PATCH routes specifically. |

### P10 — `finance/bank-accounts` PATCH `[id]` → cross-tenant `coa_id` FK injection  💰 **BANK** — ✅ **FIXED**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Route / op** | `PATCH /api/finance/bank-accounts/[id]` |
| **Table** | `bank_accounts` — `coa_id` in the PATCH allow-list, no ownership check |
| **Attack vector** | Route already allow-lists PATCH columns (not a raw `.update(body)` spread), but `coa_id` was accepted from the body and written verbatim with no ownership check, unlike the sibling POST route (P4) which verifies it. |
| **Effect** | Caller repoints their OWN bank account at ANOTHER tenant's GL account (`chart_of_accounts` carries its own `tenant_id`). `GET /api/finance/bank-accounts` embeds `chart_of_accounts(code, name, type)` off the row, so the foreign account's name surfaces back on the next read — same exfil shape as P4. |
| **Verdict** | **FIXED** (was proven-LIVE; found in the same `[id]` PATCH allow-list sweep as P9, 2026-07-13, W2) |
| **Fix** | `coa_id` is now verified tenant-owned (`.eq('id',...).eq('tenant_id', tenantId)`) before the update runs; 404 on miss. Same pattern as the POST route's P4 fix. |
| **Regression lock** | `src/app/api/finance/bank-accounts/[id]/route.witness.test.ts` (LOCK: foreign coa_id 404s, row untouched; CONTROL: own-tenant coa_id and field-only updates still pass) |
| **Verified** | `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; full `vitest run` 225 files / 1000 passed / 37 skipped / 0 failed |

### P11 — `bookings` PUT `[id]` → cross-tenant `client_id`/`team_member_id`/`service_type_id` FK injection  ⚠️ **DATA EXFIL** — ✅ **FIXED**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Route / op** | `PUT /api/bookings/[id]` (unconverted, raw `supabaseAdmin`) |
| **Table** | `bookings` — `client_id`/`team_member_id`/`service_type_id` picked via `pick(body, [...])`, no ownership check |
| **Attack vector** | `POST /api/bookings` (register P1) already verifies `client_id`/`team_member_id` ownership and scopes the `service_type_id` name lookup — but the sibling `PUT /api/bookings/[id]` picked all three straight from the body with **no ownership check at all** before `.update(fields)`. |
| **Effect** | Worse than a dangling reference: this route's own response — `.select('*, clients(name, phone, address, email), team_members!bookings_team_member_id_fkey(name, phone)')` — embeds the joined row directly, so a foreign `client_id` or `team_member_id` leaks another tenant's client/team-member PII (name/phone/address/email) in the **very same PUT response**, plus every subsequent GET. |
| **Verdict** | **FIXED** (was proven-LIVE; found sweeping `[id]` PATCH/PUT routes for the same FK-ownership gap as P9/P10, 2026-07-13, W2) |
| **Fix** | `client_id`, `team_member_id`, and `service_type_id` are each now verified tenant-owned before the update runs; 404 on any miss. Same guard as `POST /api/bookings`. |
| **Regression lock** | `src/app/api/bookings/[id]/route.witness.test.ts` (LOCK: each foreign FK 404s, booking untouched; CONTROL: own-tenant FKs and field-only updates still pass) |
| **Verified** | `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; full `vitest run` 226 files / 1005 passed / 37 skipped / 0 failed |
| **Rank rationale** | Same exfil severity as P1 (client/team-member PII, not just a dangling ref) — ranked with the P9/P10 `[id]`-route sweep since it was found in that later pass, not the original P0–P8 sweep. |

## 2. Already-blocked — regression locks (no fix needed)

Proven with a witness that the guard fires. Keep the test; do not remove the guard.

| # | Route / op | Table | Guard that blocks it | Witness |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | `PATCH/DELETE /api/jobs/[id]/sessions/[sessionId]` | `booking_assignees` (no `tenant_id`) | `loadOwnedSession(tenantId, jobId, sessionId)` selects the booking `.eq('id',sessionId).eq('tenant_id',tenantId)` **and** re-checks `job_id` → 404 before any join write | `jobs/[id]/sessions/[sessionId]/route.witness.test.ts` (BLOCKED + CONTROL) |
| B2 | `POST /api/jobs/[id]/sessions` | `booking_assignees` | Parent `booking.id` is **freshly created in-request** with `tenant_id`; job parent verified `.eq('tenant_id',tenantId)`; assignee ids validated against tenant-scoped `team_members` | (audited §3.2, safe-by-construction — no witness needed) |
| B3 | `POST /api/crews` → `setMembers` | `crew_members` | Parent `crew.id` is **freshly created** via `tenantDb(tenantId).insert` a line earlier → tenant-owned by construction | (audited §3.1a) |
| B4 | `POST /api/quotes` deals write-back | `deals` | `UPDATE .eq('id',dealId).eq('tenant_id',A)` — foreign deal matches nothing | CONTROL in `quotes/route.witness.test.ts` |
| B5 | `POST /api/invoices` from_booking/from_quote prefill | `bookings`/`quotes` | prefill re-fetch `.eq('tenant_id',A)` → foreign parent invisible, no PII copied | MIXED control in `invoices/route.witness.test.ts` |

---

## 3. Verified-safe by `tenantDb` scoping — isolation probes (context, not leaks)

These routes are **converted to `tenantDb`**; each probe seeds a foreign-tenant row
and proves it is filtered out (read) or that a forged `tenant_id` in the body can't
win (write). They are **not leaks** — listed so the register is a complete coverage
map, and so a future de-conversion is caught by a failing probe.

| Route / op | What the probe locks | File |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/clients/[id]/contacts` | contact PII filtered by `tenantDb` (no explicit route filter — wrapper is the sole guard) | `clients/[id]/contacts/route.isolation.test.ts` |
| `GET /api/crews` | foreign crew row absent from list | `crews/route.isolation.test.ts` |
| `GET+POST /api/deals` | GET lists only caller tenant; POST body-forged `tenant_id` loses to the wrapper stamp | `deals/route.isolation.test.ts` |
| `GET /api/documents` (list) | foreign document absent (wrapper is sole guard) | `documents/route.isolation.test.ts` |
| `GET /api/documents/[id]` | foreign doc → PGRST116 before any storage/signed-URL work | `documents/[id]/route.isolation.test.ts` |
| `GET /api/invoices/[id]` | foreign invoice never in body | `invoices/[id]/route.isolation.test.ts` |
| `GET /api/jobs/[id]` | foreign job → 404, indistinguishable from missing | `jobs/[id]/route.isolation.test.ts` |
| `GET /api/notifications` | foreign notification absent from list AND uncounted | `notifications/route.isolation.test.ts` |
| `GET /api/quotes/[id]` | foreign quote never in body | `quotes/[id]/route.isolation.test.ts` |
| `GET /api/schedules` | foreign recurring schedule excluded | `schedules/route.isolation.test.ts` |

---

## 4. Scanned & cleared — unconverted POST routes with a body FK that are **already guarded**

I swept every unconverted (raw `supabaseAdmin`) `POST` route that inserts a
caller-supplied `*_id`, looking for the same FK-injection shape as P1–P3. The
routes below **carry an ownership guard already** (or are platform-admin by design),
so they are **not** leaks — recorded here so Q3 does not re-investigate them.

| Route | Body FK | Why not a leak |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/projects` | `client_id` | Verified `.eq('id',clientId).eq('tenant_id',tenantId).single()` → 404 before insert (L47–50) |
| `POST /api/referral-commissions` | `booking_id` | Booking + referrer fetched `.eq('tenant_id',tenantId)` → 404 before insert |
| `POST /api/portal/bookings` | `service_type_id` | `service_types` fetched `.eq('tenant_id',auth.tid)` → 400 on foreign id; `client_id` forced to `auth.id` |
| `POST /api/attribution/manual` | `booking_id` | `bookings` UPDATE + SELECT both `.eq('tenant_id',tenantId)` |
| `POST /api/admin/comhub/send` | `thread_id` | `comhub_threads` fetched `.eq('tenant_id',tenantId)` → 404; `contact_id` copied from the owned thread |
| `POST /api/catalog` | — | Inserts only scalars (no body FK) |
| `POST /api/settings/services` | — | Inserts only scalars; scoped reads |
| `POST /api/admin/requests` | `category_id`/`territory_id` | `requireAdmin()` super-admin route; `partner_requests` is a platform table (no `tenant_id`) — **cross-tenant by design** |

**Result of the sweep:** among the routes above (swept for `client_id` /
`booking_id` / `quote_id` / `deal_id` / `service_type_id`), all are guarded — no
live leaks. This section is a **negative result, not a to-do list**.

> **Scope correction (later pass):** this original sweep was scoped to the
> *customer/sales* FK ids listed above and **did not cover the finance FK class**
> `entity_id` / `coa_id`. A follow-up pass over the `finance/*` money+bank routes
> found that class **is** live-leaking — see **P4–P7** (bank-accounts, expenses,
> periods, expenses/[id]). So "no additional live leaks" held only for the ids
> swept here; it was **not** a whole-codebase all-clear. The `entity_id`/`coa_id`
> FK-injection class is now witnessed, not a hypothesis.

## 6. Q3 hand-off checklist

1. Fix in priority order: **P0 crews (✅ fixed) → P1 bookings (✅ fixed) →
   P2 invoices (✅ fixed) → P3 quotes (✅ fixed) → P4 bank-accounts (✅ fixed) →
   P5 expenses (✅ fixed) → P6 periods (✅ fixed) → P7 expenses/[id] (✅ fixed,
   2026-07-13, W2) → P9 invoices/quotes PATCH [id] client_id (✅ fixed,
   2026-07-13, W2) → P10 bank-accounts PATCH [id] coa_id (✅ fixed, 2026-07-13,
   W2) → P11 bookings PUT [id] client_id/team_member_id/service_type_id
   (✅ fixed, 2026-07-13, W2).** All items in this register are now closed.

   **P8 sibling sweep (2026-07-13, W2, not in the original register):** grepping
   for the same `.from(<table>).update(body)` full-body-spread shape outside the
   finance FK class turned up three more live instances of the exact P7 pattern
   (tenant_id row-donation + caller-controlled FK columns), now fixed:
   - `PUT /api/schedules/[id]` (`recurring_schedules` — client_id/team_member_id/
     service_type_id FKs + tenant_id)
   - `PUT /api/reviews/[id]` (`reviews` — client_id/booking_id/team_member_id FKs
     + tenant_id)
   - `PUT /api/referrals/[id]` (`referrals` — referrer_client_id/referred_client_id
     FKs + tenant_id)

   All three now allow-list assignable columns only (see each route's
   `route.isolation.test.ts`). `PUT /api/admin/announcements/[id]` also does a raw
   `.update(body)` but `platform_announcements` has no `tenant_id` column and the
   route is `requireAdmin()`-gated (super_admin only) — cross-tenant by design,
   not a leak, left as-is (same exception class as `POST /api/admin/requests`
   in §4).

   Separately, `PUT /api/admin/recurring-schedules/[id]` (allow-listed, NOT the
   P7 shape) was missing an ownership check on its `team_member_id`/`cleaner_id`
   input — same IDOR class as the client/reschedule and bookings-team fixes
   below the P0–P7 line. Fixed: foreign team_member_id now 400s before the
   update (and before it can propagate into `bookings.team_member_id` on future
   sessions).

   No further `.update(body)`/`.from(...).update(<raw body>)` full-body-spread
   sites remain in `src/app/api/**` as of this sweep (grep: `\.update(body)`).
2. For each fix, **flip its witness** from expect-leak to expect-rejection (404/400
   + untouched victim) — the witness then locks the fix permanently. (Done for
   P0–P6.)
3. P0 needed a **hand-written** parent-ownership guard (`crew_members` has no
   `tenant_id`; converting the route to `tenantDb` alone does **not** close it).
4. P1–P3 (done): ownership verification of each caller-supplied FK before insert;
   converting to `tenantDb` scopes the row's own `tenant_id` but does **not**
   validate foreign-key ownership — the guard is separate. Same principle applies
   to P4–P7.
